# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

To install all dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

To compile the contracts and then gdeploy the contract on rinkeby testnet run the follow command:
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
